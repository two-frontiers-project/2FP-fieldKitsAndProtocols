# 2FP Open Source Field Kits Design

Details on open source field kits an associated protocols for use by the scientific community

This resource is actively under development; at present, we have posted a simple kit for taking 10-20 samples and it's associated protocols.

Shortly, we'll be updating this with where you can order different items, additional kits and protocols, and the like. Happy sampling!

Current contents:

1. kit_10sample_collection-nobanking_protocol -- metadata, kit contents, and protocol for collecting samples without banking for DNA sequencing and culturing in the field (this will happen when kits are recieved at the lab).
