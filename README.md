Details on open source field kits an associated protocols for use by the scientific community

This resource is actively under development; at present, we have posted a simple kit for taking 10-20 samples and it's associated protocols.

Shortly, we'll be updating this with where you can order different items, additional kits and protocols, and the like. Happy sampling!
